## 🛡 Experience
## Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program (Forage) – November 2024

As part of this virtual experience program, I worked as an **analyst on Mastercard’s Security Awareness Team**, completing the following key tasks:

- **Threat Detection & Reporting**: Identified and reported potential security threats, including phishing attempts.  
- **Business Security Analysis**: Assessed various areas of the business to pinpoint vulnerabilities requiring enhanced security measures.  
- **Training Implementation**: Developed and implemented targeted security training courses and procedures to address identified gaps, ensuring a more robust security posture across teams.  

This hands-on simulation provided practical insights into cybersecurity workflows and reinforced my expertise in security awareness and threat mitigation.
