# Wazuh SIEM Implementation

---

## üõ° Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system using **Wazuh**.  
The goal was to monitor and secure endpoints, detect threats, and generate actionable alerts.

**Key Features:**
- Integration of **Windows and Linux endpoints** with Wazuh agents.
- **Malware detection** via VirusTotal integration.
- **Automated email alerts** based on risk levels.
- Centralized logging for **security analysis and monitoring**.

**Components:**
- **Wazuh Server** ‚Äì Deployed on WSL Ubuntu. Handles log collection, analysis, and alerting.  
- **Agents** ‚Äì Windows 11 host, Kali VM, and Ubuntu server configured to send logs to Wazuh server.  
- **Integration** ‚Äì VirusTotal API used for malware threat detection.  
- **Notifications** ‚Äì Email alerts triggered for high-risk events.

## üìä Monitoring & Alerts

### Example Alerts Dashboard
![Alerts Dashboard](./images/wazuh_alerts_dashboard.png)

- Logs are categorized by **risk level** (Low, Medium, High).  
- Email notifications are sent automatically when **high-risk threats** are detected.  
- Centralized dashboards allow **real-time monitoring** of security events.
